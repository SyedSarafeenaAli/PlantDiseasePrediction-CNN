# Plant Disease Prediction using CNN

Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN)–based image classification system to automatically detect plant diseases from leaf images using the Plant Village dataset. The pipeline involved image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation), model training and validation across multiple disease and healthy classes, and deployment readiness for real-world agricultural use.
